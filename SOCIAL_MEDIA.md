Hey everyone! I just released the first version of **CryptForge**, a Python-based encryption tool I've been working on.

I built this because I wanted a tool that could handle both modern AES-256 encryption and classic historical ciphers (like Enigma or ADFGX) in one unified interface.

**Why use it?**
- **Hyper-Modular**: Every logic is a plugin.
- **TUI & CLI**: Use the interactive menu for one-offs or the CLI for automation.
- **Battle-Tested**: I've included 42+ units tests covering every transformation.
- **Transparent**: No cloud, no magic, just local code.

**Stack:** Python 3, Cryptography.py, Unittest.

I’d love to hear your feedback on the architecture or any classic ciphers you think are missing!
